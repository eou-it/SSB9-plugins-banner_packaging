h4. Version 1.0.3

* Expose Grails 'assign-build-number' target to assign a build number without needing to create a release package.  (The Grails 'package-release' target now delegates to the 'assign-build-number' target).
* Record the URL to the Git repository (origin/master) and the commit's SHA1 


h4. Version 0.0.1.5

* Added systool target 'deploy-tomcat' to deploy the war file
* Modify the web.xml to reflect a configuration change for the JNDI name of the datasource
* Modify the web.xml if, when generating the war file, it is configured to use CAS SSO

 
h4. Version 0.0.1.4 

* Initial release
** Support creation of a release packaging containing the pre-built war file and an installer
** Support installation into a product home, with archiving of the previous release
** Support overwriting of CSS, javascript, and message bundles (for localization) and on-premise re-creation of the war

h5. Known Issues with this version:
* Although the configuration files are also copied into the re-created war file, this capability is not functional.  Consequently, system properties should be used to reference external configuration (as the configuration copied into the war is not currently loaded properly).
